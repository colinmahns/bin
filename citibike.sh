## Quick script to mention how many bikes are available near $EMPLOYER
## Will also show how many bike racks are available near PABT
## relies on curl and jq
## curl: https://curl.haxx.se/
## jq: https://stedolan.github.io/jq/

## specify starting point (bike) and destination (racks)

racks="\"W 42 St & Dyer Ave\",\"W 42 St & 8 Ave\",\"W 41 St & 8 Ave\",\"W 39 St & 9 Ave\",\"W 38 St & 8 Ave\""
